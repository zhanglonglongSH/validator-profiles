# Bison Trails

Bison Trails is committed to hosting a community validator for the long-term. You can securely stake your tokens with Bison Trails’ non-custodial community validators, offering the same enterprise-grade infrastructure we’re known for. We designed our participation infrastructure for multi-billion dollar investment funds who need best-in-class security and strict uptime guarantees.

> “NuCypher’s upcoming mainnet launch is the culmination of over three years of work towards making privacy-preserving blockchain applications a reality. Bison Trails has been a key contributor--both via running testnet nodes and providing technical feedback on multiple aspects of the protocol. We’re excited for them to continue to play a large role during WorkLock and the subsequent mainnet launch.” - Maclane Wilkison, CoFounder and CEO of Nucypher



## Team

Our diverse 40 person team, comprised of experienced engineers and protocol experts among others, is deeply committed to secure infrastructure and building distributed systems. As long-term believers in blockchain technologies, we know that transparent and decentralized infrastructure will have long-lasting benefits for investors and for the entire blockchain ecosystem.

## Our Architecture

Bison Trails provides a multi-cloud, multi-region platform for launching nodes on any network. Supporting a wide range of protocols, we have built a system capable of launching NuCypher nodes on demand and within minutes.

The platform service is informed by the team's experience operating its own blockchain infrastructure, as well as the team's significant expertise running infrastructure in the cloud and in physical hardware environments.

Bison Trails runs validators and full nodes across many blockchain networks, running on geographically-distributed, dedicated server instances with high network bandwidth availability.


## Ecosystem Contributions
Bison Trails has a proven track record with NuCypher; we managed [Ursula Worker nodes since the first federated testnet](https://blog.nucypher.com/the-final-countdown/) in November, 2018. We continue to collaborate closely with the NuCypher development team on testing, protocol upgrades, and protocol documentation.


Bison Trails was an active participant in the Cassandra testnet challenges, running the #2 and #1 most staked nodes on the `cassandra` and `gemini` networks respectively. We also completed all phases of CASI (Come and Stake It, NuCypher’s Incentivized Testnet).


We have established lines of communication with the NuCypher team, and provide economic and technical feedback on an on-going basis. For example, [feedback](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/1674#issuecomment-590564457) on smart contract delegation, or the scoping that went into preventing [unbonded Ursula crashing](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/pull/1697). Our Protocol Specialist, Viktor Bunin, helped the team [think through the WorkLock](https://blog.nucypher.com/the-worklock/) and provided feedback on network dynamics, economic policy, slashing penalties, and stake pooling over the past year.
